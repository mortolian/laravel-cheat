# The Makefile

Many developers have a "makefile" in the root of their project. You can also add these to your composer.json or packages.json which is probably simpler.

> Remember that make files like tabs and not spaces.

```bash
# Misc
.DEFAULT_GOAL = help

You can expand the file further. I will keep on adding useful shortcuts in here as I go along.
